# Linux-LUG

This Repository is in reference to the Linux practice and learning community LUG. Here we will be delving into various Linux commands and shellscripts, thus getting comfortable with the Linux OS for future purposes as well as increasing our knowledge on some basic and essential commands which come in handy while operating on this environment.

Shellscript is basically a set of instructions or commands which are put together in a bash file having the extension of ".sh" . The purpose of this concept is to keep a list of commands written and put together for simultaneous compilation and execution repeatedly instead of writing the same commands one by one in the terminal everytime. This is time saving and a much more efficient working procedure.
